#  Excel Homework Analysis

### **What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?**

- There may be a best time to launch a campaign, as campaigns begun in Q2 have a higher percentage of success than those iin Q4.

- Music and theater appear to be the most popular categories for Kickstarter projects

- There does not appear to be a correlation betwen amount requested and success rate; further analysis would be needed to determine this to be true or false. 

### **What are some of the limitations of this dataset?**

- I do not know the parameters by which this dataset was created. There may be unforseen assumptions in the collection of the data I am unaware of

- The data is not organized by region, which could be inferred, but that inherent analysis isn't available. 

### **What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?**

- Organizing the data by region, e.g. North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc, to research success rate by that time category. 

- Success rate by category by amount requested

- Success rate by category by length of campaign

## Etc, etc, etc
